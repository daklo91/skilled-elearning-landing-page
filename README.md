Another FrontendMentor challenge. This time with scss/sass.<br>

<hr>
install and put scss file on watch:<br>
- make sure you have the latest node and npm<br>
- run from root: npm i<br>
- open terminal and cd to styles.scss<br>
- run command: npx sass --watch styles.scss:styles.css<br>
<br>
Note:<br>
If you are going to change the media breakpoints in the SCSS, make sure that they play well with the hardcoded breakpoints in the HTML picture element's sources. Publish me
